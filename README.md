# Logitech G29 Racing Wheel for Node

Bring your [Logitech G29 Racing Wheel](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g29-driving-force) into the wonderful world of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

* Subscribe to wheel, pedal, and shifter events.
* Activate simple force feedback effects.
* Set wheel auto-centering and range.
* Customize shift indicator LEDs.

## Requirements

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 4.0.0 or greater.

Make sure your wheel's [platform mode switch](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/article/Set-the-G29-racing-wheel-for-Playstation-4-Playstation-3-or-PC-platforms?product=a0qi0000006PmxKAAS) is set to PS3.

## Install

This library uses [node-hid](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid) behind the scenes. If your OS and Node version are listed under [platform support](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid/blob/master/README.md#platform-support) then you'll have the easiest install experience. If not, you may need to consult node-hid's [compiling from source](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid#compiling-from-source) guide.

```
npm install logitech-g29
```

[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) users will most likely want to remove the `sudo` requirement of interfacing with the wheel. This can be easily accomplished by creating a file at `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-hidraw-permissions.rules` with the following code. After saving the file, reboot and then you can move on to more fun tasks.

```
KERNEL=="hidraw*", SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"
```

## Example

Let's have some fun and make our wheel LEDs light up when we press the gas pedal.

```js
var g = require('logitech-g29')

g.connect(function(err) {
    g.on('pedals-gas', function(val) {
        g.leds(val)
    })
})
```

Vroom vroom sounds optional but encouraged. ^\_^
